WoT Hive is an implementation of a [W3C Web of Things directory ](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-discovery/). This implementation [is compliant](https://github.com/w3c/wot-testing/tree/main/data/input_2022/Discovery/wothive) with the standard specification but aims at providing enriched features thanks to the usage of other W3C standards related to Semantic Web technologies.

**Checkout our [wiki for more documentation](https://github.com/oeg-upm/wot-hive/wiki)**

**Temporally the functionality that introduces the registration information in the Things has been disable (version 0.2.0 and above). Also, at the light of a new update in the [Thing Descriptions the semantic validation lacks of a proper shacl shape file](https://github.com/w3c/wot-thing-description/issues/1345) and therefore it is strongly recomended to disable this kind of validation.**

##  Docker quick start
Copy this receipt in a *docker-compose.yml* file

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  triplestore:
    image: acimmino/auroral-fuseky:latest
    environment:
     ADMIN_PASSWORD: pw123
    volumes:
    - triplestore:/fuseki
    ports:
      - '3030:3030'
  wothive:
    image: acimmino/wot-hive:latest
    # volumes:
    # - ./configuration.json:/usr/src/wothive/configuration.json
    ports:
      - '9000:9000'
volumes:
  triplestore:
```

Run the docker command

```bash
docker-compose up
```


[OPTIONAL] Uncomment wothive volume to bind your own configuration file for the wothive. Default file is configured to connect the fuseki service running in the docker-compose network.

[OPTIONAL 2] If you want to change the fuseki service location (Move outside docker for instance), you can change the configuration of the wothive also via API. A `POST` request must be sent to `/configuration/triplestore` containing the in the body the following JSON. This 

```json
{
    "updateEnpoint": "http://triplestore:3030/sparql",
    "queryEnpoint": "http://triplestore:3030/sparql",
    "queryUsingGET": true
}
```

##  Jar quick start  
##### `Requires a triple store service publishing a SPARQL endpoint to store the Thing Descriptions`
#### 1. Download the WoT Hive service
Download the latest release of WoT Hive into a folder. Notice that the releases have several files that must be downloaded and placed in the same folder:
* **log4j.properties** allows to customise the logs of the service
* **schema.json** allows to perform JSON schema validation over the Thing Descriptions
* **shape.ttl** allows to perform SHACL shapes validation over the Thing Descriptions
* **wothive.jar** is the jar of the service

Once downloaded all the resources in the same folder the service can be ran using the command

```bash
java -jar wothive.jar
```

When the service is up and running a file called *configuration.json* will be created in the directory of the jar.  The service will run by default in port 9000. 
#### 2. Set up the triple store
In order to connect the WoT Hive to a remote triple store a `POST` request must be sent to `/configuration/triplestore` containing the in the body the following JSON

```json
{
    "updateEnpoint": "http://localhost:3030/sparql",
    "queryEnpoint": "http://localhost:3030/sparql",
    "queryUsingGET": true
}
```

Notice that `"queryEndpoint"`and `"updateEndpoint"` must have as value the correct endpoints of the triple store for either querying or inserting data. Finally, if the triple store implements the SPARQL protocol through `GET` requests then leave `"queryUsingGET": true`, otherwise, for using `POST`set it to false `"queryUsingGET": false`.
